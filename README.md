# Time_series
The following java Time_series exercises are similar to the Map_Coordinates ones. Once again, a .CSV file is read and represented in Processing IDE. Each row in the .CSV file for the TimeSeries exercise has two values for the X- and Y- Coordinates of each point on a graphic. In contrast, each .CSV row means a different graphic for the MultipleSeries exercise. Here, each value represents the Y- Coordinate, whereas the X- Coordinate is established by the program.  As mentioned in the Map_Coordinates exercises , multiple points objects make up a serie objects.
